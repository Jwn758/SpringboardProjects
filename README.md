# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repo will showcase some of the mini-projects and capstone projects I worked on.

Edit February 2020:
After completing my final capstone project (located here: https://github.com/Jwn758/SpringboardProjects/blob/master/CapstoneProject2/Capstone%20Project%202_FinalReport.pdf) I wanted to expand on the insights I uncovered and built out a web app that utilizes a recommendation engine. Looking for front-end developers to partner with, feel free to reach out at jin_no@live.com if you're interested!
