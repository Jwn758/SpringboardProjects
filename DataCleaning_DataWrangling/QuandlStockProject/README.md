# WorldBankMiniProject
Mini Project meant to demonstrate my capabilities working with APIs

## Problem:
1. Collect data from the Franfurt Stock Exchange, for the ticker AFX_X, for the whole year 2017 (keep in mind that the date format is YYYY-MM-DD).
2. Convert the returned JSON object into a Python dictionary.
3. Calculate what the highest and lowest opening prices were for the stock in this period.
4. What was the largest change in any one day (based on High and Low price)?
5. What was the largest change between any two days (based on Closing Price)?
6. What was the average daily trading volume during this year?
7. What was the median trading volume during this year. (Note: you may need to implement your own function for calculating the median.)

## Solution:
* Used dictionaries to organize data and answer exerices

## Deliverable:
Python Notebook demonstrating capabilities with:
*Working with APIs
*Working with Financial Data
