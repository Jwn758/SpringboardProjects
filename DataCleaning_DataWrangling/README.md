WorldBankMiniProject
Mini Project meant to demonstrate my capabilities working with JSON files

Problem:

Find the 10 countries with most projects.
Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode').
Look up missing themes since some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in
Solution: -Used pandas and dictionaries to organize data and look up missing values -Used groupby / value_counts functions to find top countries / themes.

Deliverable: Python Notebook demonstrating capabilities with: -Data cleaning -Working with JSON files
